# 🧠 AI Mental Fitness Tracker

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a Machine Learning-based Mental Fitness Tracker developed as part of my internship under the **IBM SkillsBuild program** with the **Edunet Foundation**. It aims to monitor and enhance mental well-being using predictive algorithms and meaningful data visualization.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Predict mental wellness indicators based on input data
- Visualize trends and patterns to provide insights into mental health
- Apply regression algorithms for accurate and reliable predictions

## 🧪 Technologies Used
- **Language:** Python  
- **IDE:** Google Colab  
- **Libraries:** scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Pandas, NumPy  
- **Algorithms:** Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor

## 📂 Project Files
- `Mental_Fitness_Tracker.ipynb`: Main notebook containing code and analysis
- `data.csv`: Sample dataset used for training and testing (if applicable)

## 📊 Key Features
- Trains and evaluates two ML models: Linear Regression and Random Forest
- Visualizes prediction results using Matplotlib
- Enables comparison between actual and predicted mental wellness scores

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes
- Practical implementation of regression models
- Data preprocessing and visualization in Python
- Understanding of mental wellness indicators and ethical AI usage

## 🏅 Credentials
This project was developed as part of:
- **Artificial Intelligence Internship – IBM SkillsBuild**
- Earned certificate in **AI Fundamentals and Ethics**

## 🤝 Acknowledgements
Thanks to the **Edunet Foundation** and **IBM SkillsBuild** for providing the mentorship and opportunity to work on a socially impactful AI project.
